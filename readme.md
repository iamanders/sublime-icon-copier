# Sublime icon copier

Every time Sublime gets updated your custom icon will be overwritten. Use this little script to copy your custom icon back into Sublime application package. This script will only work on OSX and with Sublime Text 3 stored in /Applications.

## Using

1. Copy your favorite icon to script folder, named "Sublime Text.icns"
2. Run `sublime-icon-copier` script from Terminal

Unfortunately OSX caches application icons for a while but it will eventually be shown.
